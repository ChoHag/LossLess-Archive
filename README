LossLess is written in C using the Literate Programming technique
developed (initially) by Donald E. Knuth. It's my first literate project
so don't expect a lot.

Literate source code intersperces prose with source code and must be
processed by CTANGLE, part of CWEB, to produce compilable C source. Get
it from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html or your
distribution's packages/ports repository. For Debian try
texlive-binaries. OpenBSD includes it in texlive_base.

nb. TeX is *not* required to compile CWEB nor is it required to compile
the LossLess binary.
